This index is a comprehensive measure of the impact of terrorism on countries worldwide. It provides insights into the frequency, severity, and overall impact of terrorist incidents, along with rankings and scores for various nations. Below is an introduction to the variables present in this dataset:\n1. iso3c: This variable represents the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code, which is a three-letter code used to uniquely identify countries or territories. It is a standardized way of identifying nations.\n\n2. Country: This variable contains the names of the countries or territories included in the dataset. It represents the locations for which the Global Terrorism Index is calculated.\n\n3. Rank: This variable denotes the rank of each country or territory in the Global Terrorism Index for the year 2023. The rank indicates a country's position relative to others in terms of the impact of terrorism, with lower ranks typically indicating a lower impact.\n\n4. Score: The score variable represents the Global Terrorism Index score assigned to each country or territory for the year 2023. This score quantifies the overall impact of terrorism, with higher scores indicating a greater impact.\n\n5. Incidents: This variable likely indicates the total number of terrorist incidents recorded in each country or territory during the year 2023. It provides insight into the frequency of terrorist activities.\n\n6. Fatalities: The fatalities variable is likely a count of the total number of fatalities resulting from terrorist incidents in each country or territory during 2023. It measures the human cost of terrorism.\n\n7. Injuries: This variable probably represents the total number of injuries caused by terrorist incidents in each country or territory for the year 2023. It provides information about the physical harm caused by terrorism.\n\n8. Hostages: The hostages variable may indicate the number of individuals taken as hostages in terrorist incidents within each country or territory in 2023. This variable relates to the impact on individuals' safety and security.\n\n9. Year: This variable specifies the year for which the data is recorded, which in this case is likely 2023. It's essential for tracking changes over time.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Importing Libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom datetime import date\nimport folium","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.566426Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.567729Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.579089Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.567639Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.577837Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Knowing Dataset","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.columns","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.581415Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.581980Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.600227Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.581952Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.598925Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().sum()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.601436Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.602331Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.621006Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.602294Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.619409Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.631706Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.632476Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.646986Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.632442Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.645368Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Checking Duplicate columns\ndf.columns.value_counts()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.672306Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.673058Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.682148Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.673013Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.681190Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.describe()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.713986Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.714757Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.747540Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.714720Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.746111Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There seem to be no Null Values or duplicate columns.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.sample(6)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.753779Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.754192Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.770534Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.754160Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.768837Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Check Unique values for variables","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df[df['Country']=='Algeria'] # experimenting","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.797045Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.797868Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.813757Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.797826Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T09:06:30.812860Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It appears to display historical data for Algeria from 2012 to 2022, including information such as the Global Terrorism Index (Rank and Score), the number of incidents, fatalities, injuries, and hostages for each year.

These insights provide a deeper understanding of the patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset:\n\n* Correlation Analysis:\n\n1. The strong positive correlations between \"Fatalities - Injuries,\" \"Incident - Fatalities,\" and \"Incidents - Injuries\" highlight the interconnectedness of these variables. This suggests that incidents resulting in more fatalities tend to also cause a higher number of injuries, indicating a higher level of severity.\n\n2. Conversely, the \"Hostages\" variable shows the lowest correlations with other variables, suggesting that the number of hostages taken may not be strongly influenced by the presence of other variables in the dataset.\n\n* Temporal Trends:\n\n1. The analysis of temporal trends revealed an overall upward trajectory in the total number of incidents, indicating a global increase in terrorism incidents over time. The year 2020 stands out as a period of significant surge in incidents, while 2016 was comparatively peaceful.\n\n2. There was a notable escalation in incidents from 2018 to 2020, indicating a period of heightened global conflict or instability.\n\n* Country-Specific Findings:\n\n1. Iraq emerged as the most affected country, experiencing the highest number of incidents and fatalities. Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Somalia also faced significant challenges in terms of the number of incidents.\n\n2. Myanmar exhibited a sharp rise in incidents from 2018 to 2022, indicating a significant escalation in violence during this period.
